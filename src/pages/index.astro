			<h1>Welcome to {SITE_TITLE}'s website</h1>
			<p>
				I'm Felix Murray Tang, a creator and innovator based in Hangzhou, China. 
				I'm passionate about exploring various fields, including programming, electronics, and mechanical engineering. 
				
				When I'm not tinkering with technology, you'll likely find me running, trail running, or hiking in nature. 
				I'm also deeply interested in history, geography, and the universal aspects of human knowledge. 
				And of course, I always make time for my adorable, albeit lazy, cat üêæ.
			</p>

			<h2>Projects, or what I'm doing</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Software
					<p>
						I'm captivated by programming because it empowers me to transform ideas
						into reality and tackle intricate challenges with elegance and efficiency.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Personal Website
							<p>
								Create a basic website with astro, and write notes daily.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							FreeBSD
							<p>
								FreeBSD is a powerful operating system that I use for various tasks, including web hosting, 
								networking, and security. I'm particularly interested in its advanced networking capabilities 
								and its role in maintaining a secure and reliable computing environment.
							</p>
							<p>
								Currently I use FreeBSD as my main server operating system running on a mini pc for host Jails and Bhyve VMs.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					Electronics
					<p>
						I'm currently learning about electronics, and I'm interested in microcontrollers, circuits, and electronics.
						I also learning about PCB design, and I'm using <a href="https://kicad.org">KiCad</a> as my PCB design software.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Mechanics
					<p>
						I'm also interested in mechanics, and I love to build things with my hands.
						I use <a href="https://freecad.org">FreeCAD</a> as my mechanical design software.
						I have got a 3D printer as my birthday gift, and I'm learning how to use it to build things like case for my electronic projects.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Reading
					<p>
						I basicly treat reading as a long term project task, and try to read at least 1 hour daily.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<ul>
				{notes.map((note) => (
					<li>
						<a href={`/notes/${note.slug}/`}>
							{note.data.title}
						</a>
					</li>
				))}
			</ul>
			<p>
				I don't categorize my content into separate sections like notes, blog posts, or documentation. 
				Instead, I keep everything in one place for simplicity and ease of access. 
				However, I do have some 'meta' notes that serve as indexes for related topics, 
				which can be helpful for quick navigation.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're interested in exploring all of my thoughts, ideas, and documentation, 
				feel free to <a href="/notes">browse through all my notes</a>. You might discover unexpected connections or insights across various topics!

			<h2>About this Website</h2>
			<p>
				After experimenting with numerous website frameworks and static site generators, 
				I've found Astro to be my current favorite due to its flexibility and performance.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've explored various CSS frameworks but ultimately decided to embrace simplicity. By leveraging the browser's user agent stylesheet, 
				I've maintained a clean, minimalist style that focuses on content.
			</p>
			<p>
				This website serves as a hub for my notes, blog posts, and project documentation. 
				I invite you to explore and discover more about my work and interests!
			</p>
			<p>This website's source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/felixmurraytang/www">felixmurraytang/www</a>.</p>
			<p>This website's content is available on <a href="https://github.com/felixmurraytang/notes">felixmurraytang/notes</a>.</p>
			<p>
				This website uses <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> as its framework and 
				<a href="https://github.com/rasendubi/uniorg">uniorg</a>,
				specifically <a href="https://github.com/rasendubi/uniorg/tree/master/packages/astro-org">astro-org</a>, as its org-mode content parser.
			</p>
			<h3>Workflow</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>I catch my ideas with any tools and put them into my org-mode notes.</li> 
				<li>
					I compose my notes using <a href="https://orgmode.org">org-mode</a> in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, 
					utilizing <a href="https://github.com/protesilaos/denote">denote</a> 
					instead of <a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam">org-roam</a> for simpler management.
				</li>
				<li>Since I separate the website's source code and content, 
					I use GitHub Actions repository-dispatch to trigger the source code's build each time I push updates to the notes repository.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This streamlined workflow allows me to focus on creating content while maintaining an up-to-date and efficient website.</p>
