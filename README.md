## Philosophy

1. Inspired by [montherfuckingwebsite.com](https://montherfuckingwebsite.com).
this website removed almost all global css. it means website's style depend on
browser's user agent stylesheet.

2. focus on content. I treat each content as note or node. they are connect by
link or backlink

3. special node as a collection of other nodes. such as

- /notes as a full list of all notes
- /tags as full list of all tags
- /machenical as a tree collection of machenical content
